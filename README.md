# PROCESS WORK
I first started off by getting my boiler plate ready and inside the body I put 2 divs centering them both. One for the backgrounds of the game and the other inside of the div which is the actual game display screen.

After all of this planning I decided to go with canvas so i deleted the div inside the container div and replaced that with a canvas tag. I then activated canvas API by declaring it and giving it a getContext function which. I also get the element canvas by id so it can be manipulated.
