# Proposal of Game
Orbital Grounds - the player will play as a space ship flying in orbit while pressing left on the arrow key to move left and right on the arrow key to move right. the purpose of the player moving in both of these directions is because they're dodging meteors. the player can also shoot meteors by pressing the z key> I will also put a function that plays music as well
